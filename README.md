## ‚öñÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### üõã‚Äç Local Storage Persistence

- Each series (one_piece, one_pace) is persisted using a unique key.
- On first load, if progress exists in localStorage, it merges with the base JSON.

### üîÑ Context-based State Management

- SerieProvider + useSerieProgress manages the state per series.
- Actions are dispatched via reducer (TOGGLE_EPISODE).

### üåé Dynamic Statistics & Visualization

- Time calculations use pure helpers (getArcWatchedTime, getSerieTotalTime, etc).
- Charts are dynamically generated and colored using HSL-based utility.
- Progress bar color interpolates from red > yellow > green based on completion.
- Make sure the JSON files (one_piece.json, one_pace.json) are present in /assets.
